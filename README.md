# PowerBI-Ecommerce-Analysis
The project uses PowerBI to illustrate the performance of an E-commerce platform.

The project's main objective was to illustrate the performance of Olist, an E-commerce platform. Viewers could gain knowledge of how Olist has been doing and the distribution of revenues among geographic locations and product categories. Moreover, the dashboard also provided the time at which has most purchases and the information of buyers and sellers.

Data Source: The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

A breakdown of how this was achieved:

Setup Process:

- Step 1: Gathering data from the source.
Step 2: Importing the data into PowerBI.
Step 3: Doing data modeling.
Step 4: Identifying necessary metrics and doing calculations.
Step 5: Building dashboard.

Conclusion:

Overall, the analysis reveals positive trends in transaction volumes and participation rates, except for a notable dip in September 2018, the cause of which remains unclear. It can be seen that most of the revenue came from the Southeast and South regions of Brazil, and the stand-out of these states is Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil. It emerged as the frontrunner, boasting transaction volumes 2.8 times greater than the second-ranked state, Rio de Janeiro, signaling a dominant position in the market. It is also possible to see that large cities and capitals, where the population is bigger, have a larger participation in revenue. 

The majority of reviews received a favorable score of 5, indicating a positive customer sentiment. Evaluating performance across Product Categories, Time & Location, and Participant Metrics shed light on crucial insights.

Notably, around 74% of transactions were credit card payments, with top product categories including high-value items like health beauty, watches gifts, furniture, sports, and computer accessories. Notably, categories with higher average freight often encompassed valuable or larger items like computers and furniture.

Analyzing transaction timings revealed a peak on Mondays, tapering off throughout the week, with the afternoon being the preferred order placement time. Interestingly, fewer orders were placed at night. 

The states in the Southeast and South regions of Brazil have the fastest average delivery time, and the orders are shipped faster than estimated. In contrast, the North and Northwest regions have to suffer from the delay in delivery time and also from the high freight, maybe because of the small population. 

Furthermore, Sao Paulo boasted the largest participant count, although there was a decline in buyer and seller numbers in September 2018, without a defined cause.

To optimize performance, investigating the September 2018 drop, focusing on the Southeast and South regions of Brazil, addressing delivery delays and high freights in specific states could enhance overall customer satisfaction and transactional efficiency.
